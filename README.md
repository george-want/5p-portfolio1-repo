# Portfolio 1 - Rainy City Tours (working title)

A site for a small tour company operating group and bespoke tours of Manchester, UK.

## User's Goal

The site's users are interested in taking tours of Manchester led by friendly, knowledgeable locals. They may be interested in a broad, general tour or in something more specific, like a music tour. They come to the site looking for information on the tours that are available, times, and to book.
In addition, they may also be interested in booking a private tour for a group, which may also include bespoke elements.
Users want the site to be accessible and intuitive, so that it is easy to find out about the product and book onto a tour.

## Site-owner's Goal

The goal of the site is to guide the user towards booking a tour with the company, by providing exciting itineraries which appeal to a broad cross-section of visitors.
These will include students and tourists who want to make the most of the city. However, the site should also intersect with specialist interests, such as music and history.
The site should make it as easy as possible for users to identify and book a tour, whilst visually encapsulating an attitude of 'industrial cool'.
