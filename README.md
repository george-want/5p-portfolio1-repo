# Rainy City Tours

The aim for this project is to provide a simple site for a tour company operating group and bespoke tours of Manchester, UK. The objective is the demonstrate my current skills in HTML and CSS. As for the site, it is intended to be a simple front-end application which provides a static, easy-to-navigate front-end site with clear purpose and emotive and responsive design.

**For clarity, the details of this company are fictional**

## The Brief

Rainy City tours is a small business providing tours of Manchester. Its unique aspects are that it is run by locals who can provide 'under-the-skin' experiences of the city, which lend it an authentic edge.
The goal of the site is to guide the user towards booking a tour with the company. In order to do this, the site needs to provide a clear call to action to book a tour, as well as providing all relevant information with an attractive aesthetic.
The company needs the following pages:
-   Homepage, featuring:
    - Navigation bar
    - About Rainy City Tours
    - Links to social media
-   Our Tours
- Contact Page with booking form 

## User Stories

Users will include a lot of people on-the-go, primarily tourists, as well as others who may be new to the city and want to get to know it better, such as students and new workers. Following are some examples of their needs, which will affect the design of the site:

***First-time Users***

- I'm visiting the city and want to book a tour but I only have my mobile phone with me to find what's available
- I'm interested in taking a tour and want to find out what this company has to offer
- I've just moved to the city and want to get to know it better, but I don't know anyone else who knows the city very well

***Returning Users***

- I enjoyed the first tour I took, now I'm interested in finding out about one of the others
- I want to contact the company about booking a bespoke tour for a small group

## The Concept

It's anticipated that most users will view the site on a mobile device, and therefore the design will be mobile-first.
When the user comes to the homepage, what they're looking for is, essentially, Manchester. Therefore the hero image will take up most of the screen on the landing page, with a navigation bar on top and call-to-action tagline unobtrusively layered on the image:

WIREFRAMES FOR MOBILE DESIGN

### Colour Scheme

'Rainy City Tours' conjures up a colour scheme mentally, mostly shades of grey. Visually this is not particularly interesting by itself, but as a background pallette they work very well with accent colours that evoke 'Manchester', such as reds and blues.
Vivid images are chosen to contrast against this background - see more in Images.

## Features

- **Mobile-first design**
    - Since most of the company's users are expected to be using mobile devices, the CSS is written for smaller screens initially
    - Elements scale up to bigger screen sizes rather than scaling down, making it more efficient for smaller devices

- **Header and Nav Bar**
    - Features the key links for the user to navigate, Home, Our Tours and Book/Contact
    - The nav bar is present on all three pages on the site, negating the need for the user to resort to browser controls such as the 'back' button
    - The Rainy City logo features in the header, maintaining brand awareness throughout the user's screen time

- **Hero Image**
    - Gives the user exactly what they're here for - Manchester
    - Text overlay welcomes the user and gives a subtle call-to-action
    - Animation of the image draws the user in

- **About Us**
    - The first chance to introduce the unique aspects of Rainy City Tours
    - Users see the reasons to come on tour with RCT broken down alongside pictures of 'guides' and tour locations
    - Link included to the 'Our Tours' page as a further call to action to check out what the company has to offer

- **Footer**
    - Includes social media links for users to check out pictures of tours
    - Social media links are chosen specifically for the purposes of visual marketing and placed according to likelihood of use
    - Instagram logo centred and largest, as this is most likely the social media site through which users will engage with us. Facebook and Tiktok left and right respectively.
    - Present on all three pages

- **Our Tours**
    - Three sections to show the user what tours are available from RCT
    - 'Manchester City Centre' top - a general tour of the city centre, suitable for anyone and everyone
    - 'Manchester Music Legends' - a more specialist tour of Manchester with a view to exploring its famous musical heritage
    - 'Manchester Pub Crawl' - even more specialist, a tour of the best pubs in the centre of Manchester!
    - Each section features an iframe of google maps with the start location of the tour
    - Each section features a selection of images 'from the tours'
    - Each section features a prominent 'Book Now' button
    - A fourth section gives the user the option of requesting a bespoke tour by using the 'Contact' form on the third page

- **Book/Contact**
    - Two separate forms - one to book an existing tour, another to contact the company for bespoke requests

### Future Features

- **Online payment**
    - The advantage of this to the company is obvious, but not yet possible with the technologies we're using
    - More reassuring to a user - these days you would expect payment to be taken online and it lends legitimacy to the organisation
